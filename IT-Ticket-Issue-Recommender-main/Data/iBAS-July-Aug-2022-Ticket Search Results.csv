Hi Solomon -

Since we are starting from scratch with our Production environment, please have the Prod LTC servers updated also to Server 2019.  We have been running our Stage on 2019 and processing is going fine.

We do not have any data on the Prod servers yet, but plan to start deployment items right away next week after the holiday.  Please have them updated over the weekend and ready for us on Tuesday, July 5 if possible.

Thank you!

The original ticket was closed today - so you this will serve to create new ticket.

CDS-Northwest,T20220630.1604,Cluster 2 DR node loss of Sync,"Cluster 2 DR node loss of Sync.

Had to address 3 instances of nodes suddenly not being able to sync within the SQL Availability groups on the prod clusters. I was able to review SQL logs for the most recent and I am starting to suspect network connection loss is the culprit. The particular instance from today shows a gap in logs but a loss of quorum at the Failover cluster level on CHUSW2PRDDBC2C. Eventually it does correct itself but I am suspecting that this occurrence explains the work i had to do in resynchronizing the DB's on Monday for Cluster 2 and 4.

Quorum was lost but there is an odd time jump in the logs that makes me wonder if the alerts i was seeing at 6am were a precursor to this.

I am suspecting network issues and given the multiple subnets and latency most DR nodes have when not connecting locally I am not sure what else it could be.","iBAS, Inc (CHCS)",SO - Firewalls and VPN,"WHITE, JOHN (primary)",Complete,Scheduled,7/1/2022 5:52,8/16/2022 4:30,Single User,Database,Administration,

If this error appears on the EOC glass (for an EDGE hub), it indicates that the automatic password reset failed. As documented, there is a log file which may indicate why the password reset failed.

If the log file does not indicate why the password reset failed or if it indicates that the process failed for an un-resolvable reason, please manually reset the EDGE hub’s ss_synadmin password. If you are unable to log into the Windows desktop, use the steps described in https://synoptek.itglue.com/2536478/docs/6004091, to manually update the ss_synadmin password with the Datto RMM agent browser first, then reset from within Windows.

Hello

Please escalate this issue as soon as possible. The CSR is unable to perform her work duties due to not having access. Per, William Barnes, ""she is unable to enter any data in the Password Field. I don't think this is an AS400 team issue, rather I think it is something that Synoptek has to fix as it seems to be something wrong when her RDS tries to open the AS400 Emulator application"". ""There is something wrong with her RDS that does not allow IBM ACS to properly open, when it does open it does not allow her full functionality of the sign on screen"".

Hello,
Coresite ticket number is CAS-02726098 and the Synoptek ticket is T20220629.0311
Coresite may have entered the Outgoing Tape Bin number into the Coresite ticket shown above but, I dont have access to it. Please look at CAS-02726098 and see if they put the Outgoing Tape Bin number and provide to me. If the Bin number is not in the Coresite Ticket, would you please contact Coresite in the Reston Data Center and ask them to give you the Outgoing Iron Mountain Tape Bin # that was used when they unloaded my 19 Outgoing Tapes this morning at 11:30am?
I need to submit my ticket with Iron Mountain today for them to come Pick Up that Outgoing Tape Bin and take to Iron Mountain on Tuesday 07/05/22.

Regards,

Hello

We had reports from CNA users that there were no Claims Review Requirements tasks in the Case 360 queue this morning, which is very rare.  Curious, I pulled reports for Claims and PHS for CNA, and as of right now, there have been no new tasks for CNA created as a result of indexed items (items recvd via fax/mail).

I went ahead and pulled a similar report for BAU and found the same thing. I do not have Pru Access, so could not check there.

Is there an issue with the OCC/indexing or Case 360, for all lines of business?

Regards,

Kathleen Brown

Hi Kathy,

Yes, OCC was down due to a database issue. It was up this morning.

Thank you

Hi Katherine,

We immediately reported the issue in the day(IST) hours and again called and reported the issues to them. They validated the parameters(memory, cpu utilization, ethernet speed etc.. ) and as per them those are looking good. But we explained that the issue is still there and the latency issues which are coming frequently.

They would do a screen sharing session and work on the issues with team tomorrow during IST morning hours as most of the offshore team members has logged off for the day.

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Nora,

We had received the domain user id for Carlone Nicholas from the Synoptek team as ncarlone. There is no database access on any prod\non-prod servers to the ncarlone.

Hence no action required from the DBA side.

Hi Team,

This request is to get Enterprise Scan installed on Ryan Madrid's Desktop.

Just an FYI, in the pass Eric Davidson completed the install.

PFB, a snip-it of the icon.

[cid:image001.png@01D89116.710C7720]

Once the install is complete, we will complete a scan test with Suresh to ensure batches are landing in the proper location.

Let me know if more information is required.

Thanks,

Hi Support Team,

My mobile is dead, and I am not able to connect VPN using Duo Mobile app authorization. Is there any other way to connect VPN? Do we have desktop application like Duo Mobile app?
Please suggest me alternate way to connect VPN until my mobile gets repair.

Hi Support Team,
The Opex computer workstations located in Pensacola Office are still on the Capgemini domain.  We will have an Opex Vendor Tech onsite on Wednesday to make changes on the workstation which will allow you to install necessary security software and make the domain change to CHCS.  Please advise the person who will make this change so I can include them in our plans for testing these changes and include them in the bridge on Wednesday if any issues arise.  I also want to confirm those Opex computer workstations are accessible and have provided the Ip addresses below.

Call participants:
Brian from Opex
Thomas Nguyen from CHCS
Stephanie Jacobson from CHCS

Process for each machine once the hard drive was replaced:

Brian from Opex already had the link to obtain the DRMM installer, so once he ran that I logged in and verified Minerva and Trend were installed. From there, I checked the IP address configuration to see if it kept the assigned address it had before the hard drives were replaced. I then changed the hostname/device name to what it had previously (pnsopeximgX where X is 1-3), restarted the machine, joined it to the chcs-hosting.com domain, and restarted the machine again. I also updated the local account that Brian created to reflect the previous local account's name and password, per Thomas' request.

Brian and Stephanie ran through some tests to confirm the machines could access the appropriate production and non-production network share folders, along with running some scans.

Once all changes and testing was completed on the three machines, Thomas confirmed this ticket could be closed and we concluded the call. I have documented the local admin account for these three machines in Secrets for future reference."

Hello Synoptek Team,

Recently we have had a problem with MS Teams not being loaded onto the New Hires laptops. This requires an extra step when starting them on their laptops. It requires that each individual call Synoptek Support and work with customer support
 to have it added to the laptops. Could you please verify that MS Teams is pre-loaded onto all new hire laptops? The lack of it being loaded is causing unnecessary delays and frustration for them on their first day. It takes about an hour for everyone to
 get this accomplished. We use Teams to onboard them, so it is required o","iBAS, Inc (CHCS)",SO - Endpoint Management,"ALLEN, ADAM (primary)",Complete,P3 - Moderate,7/11/2022 20:13,7/12/2022 18:13,Single User,Collaboration,Other,

Looking at this I think those SSL's can be removed because the GW is using the GoDaddy SSL's. I don't think the other SSL's are being used for anything else. The Gateways are all using a GoDaddy cert *.chcs-hosting.com and not the other 2. I did also fidn this in IT Glue which tells me they should be safe to delete as well.

If anything gets messed up we will know pretty quick and can just create new certs since those are also self signed. I am not 100% sure, but believe these get created during the gateway services install. However, they got changed tot he GoDaddy SSL later meaning the other SSL's become irrelevant."

I'm facing this issue frequently, and because of that my work is getting affected plus I have to spend more number of hours with Synoptek team rather than spending time on my work. Can't you just fix this permanently?

Hi Team,

I am not able to connect with Mobile hotspot on my laptop, I had tried to connect with multiple devices. Sometimes I can see it is connected but internet does not work on laptop.

Previously I had reach out to synoptek team for same issue and tried the steps which are mentioned in the attached email. But now it is not working for me.

Can you please help me to get the permanent solution for this issue, because if my Wi-Fi connection will go down due to any reason then I will not be able to continue my work.

FYI - I get 15MB+ internet speed from my mobile data.

Let me know if you have any questions or need any details from me.

Note:- Please always keep ftpservices@chcs-services.com<mailto:ftpservices@chcs-services.com> in loop.
Thank you.

Hi Rajesh,

Please refer my comments.

dbhost:
We have multiple DB production servers, which had been segregated on basis of HIPAA, PCI and Others (Shared-App).
Please let us know the VLAN- details so accordingly we can suggest the dbhost.

dbadminusername:
dbadminpassword:
From DBA side we don't provide any credentials as we use the windows authentication.
You should request to Synoptek team to create the Domain level service account for your application.
Once you receive the service account details, you can raise the request to DBA team to grant the required access.

Hi to All & Happy Monday!!

Thomas,
I was out of the office the bulk of last week unexpectedly.
I'm not sure where I would enter my dev credentials.
I'm working from home this week so I've added Avery so she can complete the testing in my absence.
Please advise.

How I completed the test:

1.  Open Enterprise Scan on desktop
  2.  Upload the profiles
  3.  Selected the State Farm profile
  4.  Scan test documents
  5.  Check the archive location - unable to validate server

Also, I'm requesting the changes below for the SF profile to help prevent scan errors.

1.  Change the name of the profile from LTC_Framework_Scan  to SF_Framework_Scan.
  2.  Remove PHS from the Document Category
  3.  Remove Backend from Process
  4.  Remove Group from Client Type

Avery,
Please update your profiles with the attached to included SF profile for UAT.
I'm going to get Jennifer to locate the test documents and hand them over to you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Chasity Monroe

Email Body: 
All,

I spoke with Ricardo from Juxto and also just got off the phone with Cecilia.

The original email in question is not a threat. It is a function of the feature of CHCS' Teams Phone System w/ PSTN. The feature is called
Voicemail-to-Email.

We confirmed that the user in question does have a phone number on the CHCS Teams environment. A scammer happened to call that number and left a voicemail. When someone leaves a voicemail for a user at CHCS,
 the system notifies the user via email. That is what the user is seeing.

It can be a helpful exercise for anyone with Teams PSTN dialing to call their work number and leave a voicemail for themselves. They will see how voicemails are delivered and thus understand that this is a legitimate
 message and not a cause for concern.

@Cecilia Flamenco [mailto:Cecilia.Flamenco@chcs-services.com] we confirmed that
 you DO NOT have a Teams PSTN account.

Note, if you would like the feature turned off for some or all of your users, that is doable. I ","iBAS, Inc (CHCS)",Merged Tickets,,Complete,P3 - Moderate,7/19/2022 2:33,7/20/2022 2:33,Single User,Miscellaneous,Email Reply caused new ticket,

Hi Shannon,
Thank you for justification.   It seems that help desk team provided a different response to this issue 'Yes. It is a spam email that redirects you to a malicious website.'    Either way,  both responses align that there is a feature that can introduce a risk of receiving unnecessary emails with potential malicious links.

@Ken Cook<mailto:ken.cook@chcs-services.com> & @Vaibhav Tawade<mailto:Vaibhav.Tawade@chcs-services.com>,   do the associates require for PSTN number to be enabled in teams?   If this feature is not required,  to reduce the risk of potential malicious links sent via this method,   I recommend disabling this feature.

Thank you,
Cecilia

Good morning Mack,

In reviewing this email,  this seems to be a phishing attempt from a malicious source.
No Legal firm will send an email to an associate from @database-breaches.com.

I recommend that this be deleted immediately from associate inbox all everyone that has received it.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Hi to All,

Thanks Thomas.
In my absence, Avery will upload the profiles first thing in the morning 7-20-2022 in attempt to scan and archive using the new SF profile.
If there are any issues, she will reach out to you directly for further directives.

I noticed #2 through #4 was not changed in the new profile. Can they be updated as well?

1.  Change the name of the profile from LTC_Framework_Scan  to SF_Framework_Scan. - Completed
  2.  Remove PHS from the Document Category - not completed
  3.  Remove Backend from Process - not completed
  4.  Remove Group from Client Type - not completed

@Avery Stearns<mailto:Avery.Stearns@chcs-services.com>
Please scan the test documents received from Jennifer using framework and undeliverable for SF.
Once scanned, please response to this email with doc, page, and batch number for the batches so they can be located in the test environment.

*   SF_Framework_Scan
  *   SF_Undeliverable_Scan

Please see attached spreadsheet of 61 calls Prudential is requesting for a complaint issue.  This request came in today.  I'm asking that this be worked and returned as soon as possible.

The spreadsheet has the date, time (EST), call rep's name & the phone # that was provided to the rep as a call back #.  This might not be the # that matches the actual call all the time.  The date and time would be best to go by.  We also listed next to the calls that are outbound calls. (ob).

If you have any questions, please let me or Danielle Stafford know as soon as possible.  Please include us BOTH on all correspondence.  I've sent this request from our shared QA email box, if that is easier to use to contact us both together.

Thanks!

Hi Team,

CCC users at offshore are complaining that they are getting calls without the ""Beep"" alert in their headphone.

The problem is faced by the entire CCC team of 15 users. We have already restarted five9 and checked but the issue remains the same. Please look into it as it hampers quality.

My laptop's speakers are not functioning. I am not able to hear other people voices, also the system alerts sounds are not coming. Even though the speakers are enabled, and the volume is also full, still not able to hear any sound. Please help in restoring the proper functioning of the speakers.
This has started some 2 hours back when my system had run some system auto updates and it got restarted.

Hi Chasity,

I have added you and Avery to the reports distro.
As of now I haven't added any filters to show only mailroom scanned items. Let me know the list of users who will scan SF docs, I can update the report to show only those items and not everyone.

Thank you

It is still currently at 87%, although I feel this threshold is set too low for this alarm anyway. SQL will reserve additional memory on a ""just in case"" basis, regardless of whether it actually ever gets used by SQL. This memory usage is likely normal, and it only increased from a lower value last night after maintenance/backups were completed (typical on a Friday night/Saturday morning).

I am closing this ticket out as the alarm has cleared. If it alerts at below 90% usage again, the alarm threshold should be investigated and adjusted by EOC."

Hi Synoptek Team,

While granting database access to a domain user in CHUSE1PRDLSNC3 clustered servers, we are getting error like 'Cannot determined if the computer joined any domain', We attached screenshot for more information.

Please note, the CHUSE1PRDLSNC3 is a cluster server having 2 nodes as CHUSE1PRDDBC3A and CHUSE1PRDDBC3B and we are getting error on both of them as well.

Please look into it on priority.

Thanks,

Hi, Synoptek!

We had a demo with Tom and Ganesh on how to access RDS today.

On the other hand, accessing prod resulted in our inability to go through this step, because we don't have computer name. Can you please help us with that too?

Hi Lawanda,

I am having issues with my laptop. I was trying to log in and I was getting very strange messages. It shuts down by itself and then told me my charger is not recognized, I am only using my dell charger.

I have attached the photos of what it has been telling me.

Your help is much appreciated.

Thank you,

Hi,

The workbench screen for IGP-CV2 is scattered, the place highlighted in yellow should have an option for search and as you can see the first two characters from ""billing & collection"" are truncated and should be visible. Not that because of this issue we are not able schedule batch cycle from workbench, pls fix this on priority.

This issue we observed while testing the fix of ticket T20220726.0033 and Sahil fixed it.

I am unable to call in from my personal cell to discuss this matter, however, I need help. My cell phone that has my DUO Mobile on it is now completely broken, thus I am unable to access DUO because of this, which is preventing from being able to log into my work stuff because I can't use the VPN without DUO. I have the app downloaded onto an old phone, but it says I need an activation code from an administrator to link my old account or a QR code. I have neither, so I am wanting someone to help me figure out how to get this set up on this phone until my new phone gets here next week. Any help resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Happy Friday Eric,

Would you please submit a ticket with Reston DC CoreSite team for Monday 08.01.22 to have them take pictures of all of the AS400 tapes and Iron Mountain Bins on hand and send to me?
I will need another AS400 tape Unloading/Loading on the morning of Wednesday 08.03.22, but before I request a ticket submission for that, I first need to see what tapes are currently in the Reston DC Synoptek cage and pics of any Iron Mountain bin numbers that are on hand at the Reston DC.

Sincerely,
William.
PS: Have a fun and relaxing weekend!! ?? ??

I am working with Cecilia on Phishing Campaign, and during the discussion, we decided if Synoptek can be uploaded a ""Phishing Awareness Document"" over each user's desktop (set as a default). With this step, users can read and adhere to the Do's and Don'ts practices of phishing.

Please do let us know your views on this. Much appreciated!

Hi,

I am receiving the below error while saving the insdoc prototype in InsPro workbench from prod rds in igp-cv1, afl-tst and igp-cv2 regions. It is observed that a few users are not facing this issue but a few do. Users who did not had issues tried to save the prototype accessing their prod RDS through my machine and they faced the same issue. So, with this we get a sense that it is neither InsPro issue or RDS issue but may be something to do with my laptop settings/configuration?

Pls review and advise. I am looping in Jatin in case if you have any questions in understanding the issue I stated above. I will be available in IST business hours and Jatin can help for any questions during CST hours.  Thanks.

Hello Team,

I received an email from 'chase bank' saying that they have seen irregular activity, however, I do not have a chase account. I feel as though this possibly could have been a phishing email. I have since deleted it, but I just wanted to make you guys aware in case this becomes a trend.

Hi Suresh,
I can confirm that there is connectivity between these LTC servers and the SQL cluster through port 1433. The ping command is using a different protocol (ICMP) which is not enabled, the reason for the timeout. If you're still having issues with the connectivity,
 let meknow and we can schedule a working session later in the day to look into it further.

Good morning:

I have been advised by 4 out of 7 of my PHS reps this morning that they are unable to get into RDS. This is an issue because we process the work out of RDS. I need to know what the issue is and what needs to be done to get this resolved.

Reps with the issue so far, and could be more as they sign in for the day:

1.  Tanya Gonzalez
  2.  Michelle Cotto
  3.  Rochondilia Morant - on a call now with Synoptek
  4.  Tilmonica Nolan - on a call now with Synoptek

Thanks

Also, this says it is in response to a ticket I submitted, I have not submitted anything.  I also logged into the Paymode site and had no alerts or messages on the site. I have not opened the below email, nor have I clicked on any links.  I also deleted it from the junk folder. I went to delete it from my deleted items folder, but it was not in there.

Hi Mike,

Can you please pull a report from Secret Server that can give me a full list of all Secrets types (not the credentials) associated with iBAS/CHCS? What we are trying to do is make sure we have a full accounting
 of everything that a Synoptek user might log in to and is thus stored in Secrets. This is related to the conversation you and I had this morning (Friday Aug 5th). The purpose will be to confirm with the CHCS CDL (Mike Reed and team) and have the
 CDL team then instruct me on the Access Types and Sub-types I will need to create for the Access Tool, in order to cover off all the potential logins that our support team might need to request.

Regards,

Email Body: 
Hi Team,

We need your help to look into this request.

We got attached automated email from Moveit server IBSMANPRDFTP02 on Sun 07-08-2022 09:21 which shows the server is still live. As per our knowledge the server IBSMANPRDFTP02 was changed to IBSMANDEVFTP03 (PFA email).

Also, we are not using the server IBSMANPRDFTP02 and synoptek team had changed the domain to non-prod server.

Impact: if the services or scheduler of Moveit application will start due to patching or any other reason on server IBSMANPRDFTP02, our jobs will start running from that server which can be impact production file transfer.

Please investigate this issue and let us know your findings, the FTP server IBSMANPRDFTP02 should be down.

Kindly let us know if you have any questions.

Note:- Please always keep ftpservices@chcs-services.com<mailto:ftpservices@chcs-services.com> in loop.
Thank you.

Good Afternoon,

A recent change or update to one of our Banking Machine Laptops has caused us to be unable to make a remote deposit (This bank uses Internet Explorer ONLY).
I noticed that IE had been removed from the start up bar and when attempting a deposit, received an error message due to security changes.
Please reverse any update which has occurred recently and restore to previous security settings.

This is for PC IP 10.195.175.34

Please do not make changes to this machine without first consulting FINANCE.

Good Morning

Can you please give an update on ticket T202208005.0677?  Natasha Durant was advised on 8.5.22 that she would need a replacement laptop. The representative that she spoke with advised that a laptop would be sent overnight. She is now being advised that she needs a manager approval. This email will serve as approval to send a replacement laptop and send it overnight. This is a priority as the representative has not been able to work for 5 days.

Thanks,

Hi Joy,
Rohit is part of our Offshore AS400 Monitoring team for Maintec.
He has 4 new people on his team who need access to the FortiClient VPN.Once they have been granted access to the FortiClient VPN, the AS400 team would submit an User Access type Team Track ticket requesting that new AS400 Profiles be created for them.
Rohit was unsure of the Request Process to get VPN access to new Offshore AS400 team members, as former Synoptek Jacob Hurd handled this.
I am not sure of the process to get them FortiClient VPN access and am hoping that you can tell me.

Hello Synoptek,

It appears that there are some sort of restrictions impacting my access to save/copy files to RDS and attach files from RDS to Outlook. Note that I do have ""Read"" access.
Can you please assist in getting the right access and/or mapping correctly to the RDS shared drive? Path: \\ibps-hosting\rds\PRU_Filer\Prudential<file://ibps-hosting/rds/PRU_Filer/Prudential>\Quality.

*   FYI - IT assistance was received previously on 9/28/2021 and the issue was resolved, but the access was only available for 30 days or so, and then the access was lost again. Since then, I haven't been able to have full access to RDS shared drive. Additional details are attached.

Hello Carlos,
Thank you for sharing the details. That packet-tracer helps. As I can learn we have Cisco at your end. As per me, your WAN is 66.179.231.84(your end) and the tunnel is built on your firewall with
 Synoptek with peer 209.42.163.130(our end).

Can you please check the packet tracer again:
pac in CHCS-PRU-Data tcp 10.20.114.9 12345 48.253.79.139 443

And then run below command to check the encap and decap is as expected
sh crypto ipsec sa peer 209.42.163.130 | in ident|encap|decap

I won't mind scheduling a working call to investigate this.
Kindly let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You !!
Good Day !!

Hello Paulette,

Sure. I will create the s3 bucket as per the requirement. However, regarding access to the AWS portal, I compared permissions with non-prod and in that also
iam-chcs-ltc-s3user user does not have permission for AWS console. Also, I am not sure if are we supposed to provide console access or not.

To upload the files to the s3 bucket we do not need to login into the AWS console. We can use AWS CLI, s3 explorer or vscode to move files depending upon the size.

----- Keeper Email from 8/2 -----  
Dear Keeper Administrator,

On August 17, Keeper's current Cloud SSO Certificate used for signing and encrypting SAML requests will expire.

On August 8, the renewed certificate will be live and available for you to download.

All customers using ADFS as the identity provider with SSO Connect Cloud must download the new certificate from the Keeper Admin Console between August 8 and August 17 before it expires to prevent downtime.

Please read the below link for more details about this update:
https://docs.keeper.io/release-notes/enterprise/other/sso-certificate-renewal-2022

Regards,

Keeper Team
----- ----- ----- 

Unable to determine if there is action Synoptek needs to take from the instructions provided: 
 - https://docs.keeper.io/release-notes/enterprise/other/cloud-sso-certificate-renewal-2022

Opening ticket to request engineering assistance. 

Secret Names that may help with investigation: 
 - Keeper Access: Keeper - synadmin@chcsna.onmicrosoft.com
 - M365/Azure AD Access: iBAS Office 365 Full Administrator Account
 - iBAS DUO Access is already provided to most SO-Server Team members
 - CHCS-Hosting Admin:  CHCS-Hosting.com Synoptek Domain Admin Account

Additional Info: 
DUO is provisioned when a CHCS-Hosting account is added to the CHCS-VPN-Users Security Group.
 - Users > Directory Sync has to be performed in DUO for new users to display. 
Keeper is provisioned when a CHCS-Services (Azure AD/M365) account is added to the 'App Access - Keeper Password Manager' group. 
 - M365 takes up to an hour to apply the change, then an email goes to the new user with the Keeper Invitation. 
Users log into Keeper with SSO set-up through M365 but must auth the login attempt with DUO. 
 - Upon first login they will first have to have their Keeper access from their machine authorized in the Keeper Admin console, future logins will get the DUO MFA prompt. 

Request: 
 - Investigate what, if any impact there may be. 
 - If there will be impact, performing the update to the certificate would be appreciated.","iBAS, Inc (CHCS)",SO - Server Engineering,"HOFFMASTER, OWEN (primary) | HUNTER, BRADY | MCDONOUGH, ERIC | MCNEILL, JOE | SHOOK, JOY",Complete,P5 - Service Request,8/11/2022 20:37,8/18/2022 20:37,Single User,Server Management,SSL Certificate Renewal,

Rach,
I am just looking into some of the users that have already been setup with screen recording, and I am noticing that some users are not getting ever screen recorded and just wondering why that is. The user in question that we can use to
 look at this is Juanita Pettigrew. During the month, she has had gaps in phone calls rec","iBAS, Inc (CHCS)",SO - Voice,"SHOOK, JOY (primary) | WILD, ELIE",VN-2,Scheduled,8/16/2022 2:38,9/16/2022 2:30,Single User,Endpoint Management,Other,"Most of the files that appeared missing have now uploaded and appear available.
The upload is very dependent on the agent's internet connection/upload speeds.
As the screencap files are very large visual files, the upload can take quite a while.
As well, if the agent closes the Five9 software or sends their laptop to sleep - the file upload can pause and will not resume until the agent next logs in. 
These situations sometimes gives the impression that a call is missing the screencap.
After more time passes, the screencap file does tend to appear."

Email Body: 
Support,

The permission to the sonora.ear on the 2 LTC Production Case360 servers does not match.

On CHUSE1PRDAPP06, the SVC_CASE_PROD_LTC account that JBoss uses has ""Full control"" permissions to the sonora.ear deployment.  This is as it should be (see highlighted on 1st snippit below).   This allows application deployments by the Case360 on this server as it should.

On CHUSE1PRDAPP05, the SVC_CASE_PROD_LTC account that JBoss uses does not have ""Full control"" permissions to the sonora.ear deployment.  This is incorrect (see highlighted on 2nd snippit below).  This prevents application deployments by the Case360 on this server.

Plese adjust the permissions on CHUSE1PRDAPP05 for the entire sonora.ear folder (and its contents) to allow ""Full control"" access to the JBoss service account (SVC_CASE_PROD_LTC ).  These permissions should match that of sonora.ear on the CHUSE1PRDAPP06 server.

Good afternoon Synoptek,

The CapQ latency issue previously reported on 8/5/22 and 8/10/22 has become a lot worse to the point that I can't even exit out of the system because it is not responding. Details regarding previous emails are attached for your consideration. I tried resetting RDS and laptop but the issue still persists. All other systems in RDS are working fine.

Please assist as soon as possible. This tool is essential for me to complete my daily work assignments.

Prudential Team,
Please let us know what is different in the AVAS Webservice non-prod environments* than Production.  We are getting the same error java.net.SocketException: Connection reset in all 3 non-Prod regions, but not in Production?

CHCS and InsPro have not made any changes in the non-prod environments or network, so we need to determine if changes were made in the AVAS webservice.

This issue has been open for weeks and we need to get this resolved as it's holding up LTC releases.

Thanks
Ken
 *we're building out a new Tech Upgrade environment, but we 1st need to get the AVAS callout working in the existing non-prod.

Hi Mike and Adam,

Looks like there is an issue with five 9 where offshore agents are not able to login. Soft phones failed to register on the proxy server.

We need immediate resolution as it will impact on SLA which may result penalty.

Please look into the issue ASAP

Email Body: 
Thank you Anupama.

Synoptek team - Can we investigate what occurred here?  The ticket was resolved relatively quickly - was this a simple server restart?  The problem occurred twice so far today.  Is there a way to monitor or something that can be done to prevent happening in the future?

Call Center SLA's are real time based on when calls come through so this poses major problems for us.

InsPro is making a firewall upgrade on Aug 28 that needs to go to CAB.  Please have a CAB request submitted.

We'll need a Synoptek network engineer as well as a CHCS IT or Ops person assigned to validate the firewall update has not impacted connectivity and InsPro Workbench access on Sunday after they install the firewall upgrade.

Please have the EOC validate when the alerts clear, if there are any issues, if needed engaged the network on call engineer.

Thanks
Ken

Can you please have these numbers reviewed to determine the reason for the incoming failed faxes? Can you also provide a list of faxes sent to 866-357-8479 from these numbers from May to current dated that shows whether the fax was successful or if it failed?

I did telnet to database server it is taking around 24 second,
It should get connected in less than 10 seconds then it will execute next steps

I validated Staging server it is taking less that 3 seconds, there must be some latency issue in production servers.

Note: @V N Suresh Kumar Siddabattuni<mailto:sureshkumar.siddabattuni@chcs-services.com>@Vaibhav Tawade<mailto:Vaibhav.Tawade@chcs-services.com> In case of failed installation, lot of cleanup is required which will cause lot of rework. hence it may delay the process.

The default schedule for these is on the 2nd Sat of the month, but in SOME cases, this should be moved to the 1st Saturday. This was done to avoid having prod-patching during the first 5 days of the month. Business requirement.

This ticket should prompt the patching team to look and see if the first Saturday falls outside of the first 5 days, and the second Saturday falls AFTER patch Tuesday, then (and only then) should the Prod patch weekend move from the second to first weekend.

For 2022, this affects May, August, and November, and Jan (2023).

Hi Vaibhav,

I debugged further and conclusion is Exstream bootstrap does not support windows authentication for Sql server,  to address this issue I need to go and modify the script and validate it thoroughly
Its risky approach since script is huge and thorough testing will be needed for all the installed component which is very difficult in the available time frame.

Can we have a Sql server authentication for database to run this smoothly

Thank you!!

This is an urgent ticket as I have to complete User Acceptance testing on our State Farm project today.  Please do not reset any of my DEV RDS Credentials, just look into what the disconnect is between the application and DEV RDS.  I am in other applications at the moment in DEV RDS and if you change my credentials that could kick me out of the things I can work on.

Good morning Alok,

I wanted to reach out to you for additional assistance. I have watched Maressa accessing all her systems, but when she was trying to log on in Case 360/Citron using credentials associated with it, it gives her an error message. We have tried a few times.

I have recommended that she contacts Synoptek which she did this morning, and they are unable to assist because they are not find anything without TT number which was assigned to her new access on Monday. Please advise on how we need to go about this as we need access to all the systems so we can start the training process.

I appreciate your assistance.

Hi Team,

We figured out one discrepancy between 2 environment's RDS Edge setup while opening a new tab through workbench. This is mostly creating an issue with InsDoc functionality. We have to configure the browser policy of PRUDVI01 Edge RDS to match other non-Prod regions (Example - PRUTST01 Edge and PRUCNV01 Edge).

Example - for PRUTST01_inspro environment - when we generate and open an InsDoc document, the new tab is opened in Internet Explorer Mode and the document is opening correctly. But for PRUDVI01 region (IP Prud from RDS Dev URLs), the new tab is not opened in Internet Explorer mode and we are getting 401 Unauthorized error. (as the JSessionID is not being passed with the URL). All screenshots are below
