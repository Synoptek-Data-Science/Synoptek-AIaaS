Hello Team,

I can confirm that the account works just fine. I reset her password and signed in using Microsoft Edge and this is what I see


If she's not seeing the shortcut for Outlook online, she needs to click on the 9 dotted icon on the top left highlighted in the screenshot above.


Outlook configuration works fine on my end as well:

When she sets it up for outlook, a windows should pop-up similar to that when logging in to office.com to authenticate. If she's not seeing that, there's an issue with that computer.  You might want to try running the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant to see if that would help.

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/about-the-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-e90bb691-c2a7-4697-a94f-88836856c72f

I've reset and resent the password to her Gmail.

Let me know if there's anything else you need help with.

Thanks!"

Hello Synoptek,

I have begun to use the laptop provided by CHCS Services.  I previously used a laptop provided by Capgemini.  I have transferred my files between the two laptops. However, I am missing any documents I placed in the Teams folders in the HR Operations file structure.  I attempted to Sync and did not get any results.  My Teammates can see those files, but I cannot.

Can you please guide me regarding the Teams files transition?

Best Regards,

Nora Dugger

Hi All,

This is to inform you that five9 has stopped working for the entire team. Those who are on calls are reporting no voice on live calls and those who get logged out are unable to login back. All station are showing disconnected.

I just tested and am able to get in here with no issues and was able to produce a call with no issues. This could be an issue with your VPN connection through Capgemini. Is the US team having the same issues?

Hi Adam,

This could be an issue with the VPN however for those its working they are connected through the same VPN. And moreover we have tried logging in without VPN as well, it still gives the same error.

Meanwhile I am asking affected users to disconnect VPN and restart their machines again and the try.

Regards,
Shoaib Khan

Email Body: 
All,

We have tested everything on the Five9 side and cannot find an issue on the five9 system. Due to the users affected by this it is pointing to a group policy or software (whether antivirus or firewall) update
 that was pushed to the Noida team that is affecting this.

We have tested the station ID on another computer and it is working fine. Please assign a tech resource at Capgemini that can look into pushes that may have been sent out today.

Subject: RE: My Outlook folders- who can assist me

Robin,
I don't use RDS so I can't see if I have the same issue, and I don't have a CHCS laptop.  My only advice is to send an email with screen shots to Synoptek Support support@synoptek.com<mailto:support@synoptek.com>.

Thanks,
Ken

Hello

Aakash Kulshrestha is our Trainer in India.  His laptop stopped charging last week.  Sounds like the charging port is bad.  He keeps it plugged in but the laptop will not power on.

He entered a ticket with BSV IT last week.  He has not had a single update on the ticket.  He needs a new laptop ASAP.  He has a lot of new hires onboarding every week and this is making it extremely difficult.

Is there any way you can look at this ticket number and offer any assistance?

Thank you!

Please send credentials to her personal email address - esquiveltara1@gmail.com<mailto:esquiveltara1@gmail.com> or call her at 480-283-4475

I'm not sure what the process is for new employees receiving CHCS computers.  Up until now, new employees were provisioned and credentialed through Capgemini.

Hi Team,

I received the laptop on Monday, on the same day I've tried to start it. During the first-time setup process of the laptop which start automatically when the very first time we boot the machine after removing it from the box. I'm stuck for more than 6-7 hours at the below step number 9 of the 'CHCS Services - Laptop First Time Setup Guide' ...

Section II - Laptop First Time Setup

Step by Step Configuration

9. Next an Intune Enrollment page will show ""Setting up your device for work"" - This page can take some time as it's downloading software and configuring your laptop.

Hello,
I have begun setting up my new CHCS laptop, but I think I'm at a brick wall.  I have done the initial setup, basically turning it on for the first time, and getting logged onto it.  I have done the Duo Enrollment, so I have that, however, I have not received anything regarding Keeper Security or credentials for https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__CHCS-2DHosting.com&d=DwIFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=VJm3HREGiVLl2n91z3A4o7wYVt53FeLTZBHwuTC_IYg&m=adjH3XozeSWz6UwsSW9oWB1jg2HqtZNT1QDiiwoPcpM&s=RfZVDm0yMGvgrmevntxsmGd8QhTP3drcGRep52UvQts&e= or VPN credentials.  Do we have an ETA on when we will be receiving that since we have to test a new production environment on our CHCS laptops.

Hello,

I just noticed in setting up my CHCS Laptop that I am missing the Fortinet VPN client. I also want to make sure I have no future issues with updates in the future on my laptop. I am connected to CHCS services via Azure AD but just want to double check and also have the VPN Forticlient installed. Thank you___________________________________________________________

If this error appears on the EOC glass (for an EDGE hub), it indicates that the automatic password reset failed. As documented, there is a log file which may indicate why the password reset failed.

If the log file does not indicate why the password reset failed or if it indicates that the process failed for an un-resolvable reason, please manually reset the EDGE hub’s ss_synadmin password. If you are unable to log into the Windows desktop, use the steps described in https://synoptek.itglue.com/2536478/docs/6004091, to manually update the ss_synadmin password with the Datto RMM agent browser first, then reset from within Windows.

Good Morning,

When I log into Keeper security to get my credentials, I click on DUO push and it goes to my phone and I click on approve then that is what I get on the website.   I have tried both of these and nothing happens and I can't get on the website.  Please let me know if you need further information.

Hi,

While setting up the new device it fails in the ""Device Preparation"" step. Upon clicking the ""show details""  I see that it successfully completed the below steps:

*   Securing your hardware
  *   Joining your organization's network

The failure I can see in the step

*   Registering your device for mobile management

This has happened several times. Once it fails I do a ""systemreset -forcereset"" , however it fails again while registering device for mobile management. Pls advice and let me know if any details are required from my side. Thanks.

Hello,

I am having an issue with my Keeper. I have set it up prior and was able to get in once to get my login passwords and credentials. But when I'm trying to log into it again so I can have access to the passwords and log ins. I get the one notice to send a push notice to my phone - which I confirm. But then it says that the device approval is needed. I can send an other Push notice, which never comes up on my DuoPush app on my phone or send to the admin; which I'm not sure who is the admin to approve my device. Please advise of any action or help to get me access to Keeper

Hello,

I set Keeper Security up using my desktop computer, Google Chrome is my default browser. I found out that I should have set Keeper Security up initially on my laptop. Because of this, I am unable to access Keeper Security on my laptop.  Also, Jacob Hurd had already given me my user ID's and passwords back in December, so I did not send an email to have them updated in my vault.

I think there are two things I need:

1.  Can you please send the user id's and passwords to my keeper vault? My email is joan.miller@chcs-services.com<mailto:joan.miller@chcs-services.com>.  My user name is jmiller@chcs-hosting.com. I already have a User Name and Password for the Production Environment and for the Development Environment.
  2.  I cannot access the Keeper vault using my new laptop, even if I try to go in using Google Chrome (default browser).  Can you please tell me how I can access Keeper Security on my laptop.  Below are screenshots where I tried to access from my laptop:

Hi,

I was able to access the internet in the office using a docking station and an ethernet cable on Tuesday. As of yesterday I am now unable to connect to the office LAN using the docking station and the ethernet cable. We have extra ethernet cables in the office. I have tried several and none will connect. All wires are getting a green and flashing connected light on the docking station. All other ports are the docking station are working as expected.

I have diagnosed the internet connections several times with the below results:

1. There might be a problem with the drive for the Local Area Connection adaptor
2. The Ethernet 3 adaptor is disabled.
3. Problem with wireless adaptor or access point. I have ruled this out because the connection lights on the docking station appear to be working. The mouse, keyboard, and monitors connected to the docking station work.
4. A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken.

I still have not had my issue resolved. It seems there was going to be some research done to get past the admin credentials needed so that forticlient can be installed via Company Portal but I have not heard anything back yet. Just checking if there are any updates.

Those sections may just need the documentation we’ve been working on – but I don’t have the complete process from the CHCS side….

I’m also not entirely clear if our process is fully worked out as I’ve been told the Customer Admin team wants to work only from the MACD requests.

Also – the Keeper piece is a challenge.

So, I don’t think I can have a COMPLETE process in place for this at this time.

Hi Joy.

A few comments.

1) We don’t have an inventory of peripherals yet. Ron was to prepare a quote yesterday but I didn’t see it come through. I believe Ron is OOO today. I suggest we do a one off order this afternoon when @Corey Lawler comes into the Boise office. Will need to get a shipping address for Carroll.
2) Need you and Mike to review the onboarding process document I sent out – see attached. There are two sections that I need you to complete. They are highlighted. We can’t send the document to CHCS until those sections are inserted.

Thanks

Hey guys,

I think we’ve gotten the first hardware request in a ticket.

T20220210.1245 - Hardware Request: Mouse, Keyboard, and Ethernet Cable
Carol Morris

The ticket has evolved, but her latest request is for Mouse, Keyboard and Ethernet Cable.

How should we handle this in the transition period? (I’m sorry if this is covered in your document from Wednesday Tim, I haven’t had the chance to really read through that process.)

Can any tell me what our process (or interim process) is for these requests?

Hi Bharat,

I had a screenshare session with Solomon today.
The issue is occurring because User Session stickiness is not working as expected from Case360 LB URL. He is working on this issue. (Issue#489)

Email Body: 
Hello,

I was on my CHCS laptop this morning. I connected to FortiClient and logged into AWS. As I was reviewing icons and folders to ensure they will all be available to me, I got a message:
""Remote App Disconnected
Because of a protocol error, this session will be disconnected.
Please try connecting to the remote computer again.""

I did get disconnected from AWS and booted out of Chrome.
I tried to open Chrome again, but couldn't.
I next thought I would disconnect from FortiClient and reboot and start all over again.
I clicked on disconnect from FortiClient East.
My cursor is now just spinning and I can't get into anything, not even Task Manager.
I tried shutting the laptop off, but when I turn it back on, it is right back at the same spot with the cursor spinning on the screen.

It is vital that I get reset as quickly as possible as I am a Flexi tester and need access for a potential GoLive date of 2/23/2022.

Hi Team,

I called on Friday 2/18/2022 and again today for my credential to be uploaded into Keeper.
I was advised that someone would be reaching out to me.
This email is to create a ticket number as I did not receive one while on the call and I forgot to ask for them.
Can you please give me an eta for this to be completed as I need to test FortiClient before we go live.

Thanks,

Hi,
I got a new laptop a week back and am noticing a new issue which needs looking into.
I am facing a lot of internet disconnections all throughout the day even though I have the same internet connection as earlier (100 MBPS stable connection) and never faced something like this on my old CG laptop.
In my case, laptop gets disconnected from internet for a few seconds and connects back. Don't know whether this is due to a wifi issue on the laptop or something else.
Becomes very challenging when someone is on a call as the call gets disconnected apart from all other connectivity issues like mail, etc which stop working when the internet connectivity drops.

Need someone to help fix this issue on my new laptop.

I am in the India timezone and can be reached at +91 9769139781 between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM IST

Thanks
Prashant

Hi,

I am facing issues with Laptop setup. The first time setup failed after which I tried the below steps, post which it still failed:
1. Press Shift + F10 - this will bring up the command prompt
2. Perform the 'SystemReset -forcereset' command
3. Select 'Remove everything'

Please help me resolve this issue.

Hello,

This ticket had been closed, as I was able to access my Keeper yesterday, but I just went to go open my Keeper after last time it working. And ran into the same issue again. I have taken a screen shot of what is happening. After I send the one Duopush and approve it I come to this screen.
[cid:image003.png@01D82886.93A8EDC0]

I sent an other Push notice and it does not come to my phone.
[cid:image006.png@01D82886.93A8EDC0]

And it just stays there - no notice to my phone and I am unable to get access to my Keeper to access my passwords for the Hosting or DEV.

I have my Keeper Credentials and can access my Keeper vault and Duo Mobile.

However, I cannot access the Remote Access VPN under FortiClient.

I am entering my username as: tpeck@chcs-Hosting.com
I have tried many passwords which do not give me access.

I get the Warning message:  Credential or SSLVPN configuration is wrong (- 7200).

Can you please contact me, so I can gain access to my VPN?

Hi Team,

We have a laptop in the Mailroom that is only used for processing CD's.
This laptop is called the Saw Workstation.
We received 2 laptops a while back in which Sam set them up in the back of the mailroom when he was here for the network cutover.
I received any directives on them and I honestly forgot about them until now.
I'm assuming that we are currently using is Capgemini and the new laptops is CHCS.
If that is the case, we will need someone to setup the Saw workstations.
If that is not the case, we will still need to ensure the current workstations can be used with AWS.
These laptops are used by multiple users and have restrictions.

I've copied all for the following reasons:
John Werdann has a Saw workstation in the Finance area as well.
Jacob is aware of the new laptops.
Vaibhav and Paulette was a part of the implementation of the Saw Workstations.
We all know why Katherine is included :)

Please provide a ticket number for tracking purposes.

Thanks,
Chasity Monroe

Hi Support team,

I got the below email which contains my new https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__chcs-2Dservices.com&d=DwICaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=lXVQKPQcW1NQNprS6zLd_35EsYwMHpO5zna_MGAJEtc&m=asXcNxomAyOPQf4Pfq21rK-ioV8GRPlUipuwFKveYNA&s=Z7uLwTQmQ0axCl8BYG8za7n5uSX6xoE8PD_Zmwew2N0&e= email address

But just to let you know, i already have a https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__chcs-2Dservice.com&d=DwICaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=lXVQKPQcW1NQNprS6zLd_35EsYwMHpO5zna_MGAJEtc&m=asXcNxomAyOPQf4Pfq21rK-ioV8GRPlUipuwFKveYNA&s=TMbQrlMqv41JOKoms6BKKUlHSpqa0GQUavA37OVIGi0&e= domain email id
which is divyesh.kotekar@chcs-services.com and I am already actively using
that email ID.

Just so as to avoid any duplication and also to avoid any confusion, can I
login to the chcs laptop using my existing https://urldefense.pr

Hi Sean,

I am able to access it now. I discovered that I am only getting this message in a particular chat group. Someone from that chat group uploaded a document to the chat and I think that may be what is causing the error message to display.

Good morning Synoptek Support team,

It has been identified that the Troom Site below from Capgemini, has been converted to the CHCS Sharepoint site listed. Is there anything special that needs to be done to share the new CHCS SharePoint site with our external users (Prudential associates)?

Some of our external users had access to the old Capgemini Troom. Do we need to just send them the URL to the CHCS Sharepoint site for them to access it, or is there something additional that's needed?
The Troom Help Manual, and External User Guide that's found on the CHCS SharePoint site, is geared towards Capgemini not CHCS, and they appear to be outdated.

Email Body: 
Hello Customer Support,

Per the email thread below, in order to connect to the client's (Prudential) server, I needed to install the VMware Horizon Client Software. I installed the software successfully, however as noted in screen shots, when I tried adding the server I use on my old Capgemini laptop to connect to the Prudential VDI, I was not successful. I also tried past server names to no avail.

Per the immediate email below from Clarence with Capgemini IT team, he suggested I enlist your assistance to get this resolved.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Hi Help Desk Team,

Could you guys please make the process simpler and faster. Why is her network ID getting disabled multiple times.

It is impacting the delivery. We need immediate solution to this request.

We can connect to the help desk 866-736-3399 if that helps.

I had provided Santhoshi Vytla contact number. As I am stating again she is not able to log into any of the capgemini  network ( Outlook / Teams / Laptop )

Mobile Number : 513-488-2341
Email Address: santhoshi9407@gmail.com<mailto:santhoshi9407@gmail.com>

We need immediate solution and not mails.

Thanks,

Hello,

I am attempting to login to FortiClient to try and get connected to the VPN. When I attempt to connect it does not get past 10% and this error message comes up

My laptop is saying I do not have internet as well, but I have verified I do as my desktop is connected along with my phone as well. I have restarted my laptop and disconnected and reconnected to the wireless with no change.

Thank you,

Hello,

I am trying to test Flexi Financials today before GoLive this weekend. My Flexi Financial AWS RDS seems to be hung up. It is not responding and the cursor just spins on the screen.  I have tried several times, and with Thomas Nguyen's help as well. I tried the System Reset Option and Flexi Financials is still ""not responding"". I am able to successfully log into other programs on AWS RDS on my CHCS laptop with no issues.  Can you please reset or disconnect this program behind the scenes so I can log in?

It is important that this be done quickly so I can continue with my testing.

My AWS RDS user name is jmiller@chcs-hosting.com<mailto:jmiller@chcs-hosting.com>.
My Flexi Financials user name is jmiller2

Thank you.

Hi Jacob & Team,

I am not able to view all the prod icons in chcs rds which I used to view in the cis rds. Also please provide the access to all the respective applications, as we have a daily work item of proceeding with the application availability check and for that reason the visibility of the icons and their access is must. Please update it on priority.

Issue number: 605

PFA, to get clear idea of the icons that needs to be shown visible on chcs rds. Also get all the application icons which where earlier hosted on citrix which needs to be hosted on rds now.

Thanks,

I have a data of almost 20+ GB in my old laptop which I need to transfer in CHCS laptop. I tried to use One drive and move the data but due to heavy file it's not getting uploaded on drive.

Would request you to please help me in this data transfer process as this Learning and Development data is very important and I may need all of them for my future projects.

Hello Ken-
I have been able to get in.  I didn't realize that the password change that I made a few weeks ago when I was doing some of the testing carried over.  So I did get in.

I was having issues actually loading the systems.  When I clicked on Open nothing was happening.  However, right before sending this email I tried again and have been able to get Case 360, Citron and Inspro to open.

Hi Team,

We observed that few of our FTP jobs are failed due to 'Possibly it was deleted by a real-time virus checker that I was unable to recognize' we have reached out to our vendor and came to know that this issue is happening as below mentioned files and folders comes in Antivirus scanning.

The recommended solution suggest by vendor is exclude the below mentioned files and folders from Moveit production DMZ server https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__IBSMANPRDFTP03.chcs-2Dhosting.com&d=DwIFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=4R5KfZJsEYzGDFkWGKm0QFIvkYo0FhapqINnMBTTLaM&m=q-s3Me1qVAga1A7B8UpnTsnHI_RMQZvISkuQrpcRiPs&s=WxNGJNL1JClpTWSsTYpUYjYB2AgOoVghi6AbtFXISds&e=

Please treat this request as a high priority and let us know if you have any questions.

*   MIAdmin.exe
  *   MICentral.exe
  *   tomcat8.exe
  *   We also recommend excluding Moveit Folder location:

Hi

When I open WORD inside RDS, the system, while still opening word, brings me to the login screen. As you can see in the highlighted section, it is added a path for word to the URL. In order to get my ICONS back I need to erase everything after RDWEB.

I have heard several people taking about RDS logging them out. Thought I would share this screen print, as that may be part of the issue.

Hi, Nancy, We've worked with a couple other users on a similar issue and in their case the Vmware Software installed and opened without issue, however, the server connection name missing was the roadblock. Is it the same in your case
 or where are you stuck?

Thanks,

Hi Rajesh,

Can you suggest how many users are getting this error?

Can you please share their Names and Login ID's. Looks like there passwords needs to be changed. The current password may not be working for the users. You will have to request to Synoptek support team to change the password. Once the password are changed you will receive the changed password in an email from Synoptek support team. Ouse that password for login into CITRON.

Please let me know if this does not solve the login issue for the users.

Regards,

Good Morning,

I run this Claim Macro daily for our current Service Level Agreements with our client.  When I ran the macro on Saturday while testing it was working, however today I am getting the following error and the Macro will not run.

The location of the macro is as follows:  PRU Filer/Schedule_Citron_InsPro_Reports/Claim_Micro_Prod_CIS/Claim_Micro_Prod_CIS/PROD Macro Reports.
The specific report name is:  SLA#4-5Claim Payments

However, I've tried the other macros and they are not working either.

Thanks

Good morning all,

Do we have an estimate on when this will be fixed?  I have a weekly file I need to QR using InsPro prior to it being sent to our vendor.

Thanks,

I do have a printing exception because I submit state reports.  I NEVER would have a reason to print from InsPro and I am not on a VDI. I have a Prudential issued laptop.   Kristen Koerner (X067548) is having issues as well and has the same exception for printing that I have and a Prudential Laptop.

Thanks for letting us know.  The way Prudential implemented local printing impacts anyone's ability to access the CHCS RDS. Pru GT has a meeting later today to work through a strategy to resolve the proxy issue the 4 of you are experiencing, so we'll add you and Kristen to the list of impacted users.

Thanks,
Ken

*Prudential implemented split VPN to enable local printing, with privacy / securiy proxy settings locking down the laptop but enabling local printing.  Only those at Prudential with local printing have the split VPN configuration, which has proxy settings blocking access to CHCS RDS.

Hi ,
We are Not able to access another server folders from run command on app59, earlier we used to access the same in CIS.
Reason to have access:

*   it is necessary as only two users can only connect a particular server at a time.
  *   It is convenient to login one server that several servers at a time.
  *   It will eliminate one person login to several server hence will save time.

We need access like as follows, all below mentioned servers should be accessible from APP59 as well as from each other.

Just an Example, we should be able to access following servers from APP53
IBSMANPRDAPP38, CHUSE1PRDDBC2A, CHUSE1PRDDBC2B, CHUSE1PRDDBC1A, CHUSE1PRDDBC1B, CHUSE1PRDFIL13, CHUSE1PRDFIL01, CHUSE1PRDFIL04,IBSNMANPRDDB11, and

Can you pls log a ticket for the following two issues raised by our end Client users from CNA.

*   When users try to access virtual desktop, there are no documents in there due to which users are unable to upload documents into Case 360
  *   Overall slowness when navigating to upload/download documents. This was not the case during UAT but is being seen now

Kindly note that this is across the board for all CNA users and not for any one specific.
If required, we can setup a call with a CNA user who can show us both the issues.

Jacob/Josh - We might need your assistance here.

Thanks

Hey!  I have 2 issues that I've found with my RDS folders.

1.  When I log into RDS I can access my folders but they are not the same folders that are showing in my One Drive.  I can't get them merged, and I can't share them with the 2 folders.

1.  There is an FTP folder for me to send calls to Prudential that is now not in either file folder that I use.  Can you please help get this added back as I use it often.  The path for this folder is: Network/IBSMANPRDFTP04.ibps-hosting.com/E/CHCSWEB1/NICE/PRUDENTIAL

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!

Hello:

Please advise I would like to create a ticket for the lag time in our reporting software of Cap Q.  It takes approximately two minutes or so after creating a sheet to get back to the home screen.

It also freezes periodically while creating a sheet selecting certain drop downs.

The current issue overall is just the ""lag time"" and periodic freezing.

Thank you,

Alex Washam

..........................................................................................................................

Hey Judy,

I am not sure if this has been reported, but Cap Q is still not operating correctly.  I assume it is across the board, but I am not sure.  I am not sure if we can report this to someone.

Thank you,

Alex

Good afternoon!

I recently submitted a ticket because I was not able to access FortiClient. Around 2:30 PM my access to FortiClient was restored, but now I am getting a pop-op from User Account Control / Registration Utility (below).
Keeper and laptop credentials were used to continue, but neither was recognized. Can you please help get this issue resolved?

Paul,

I am approving access for Tatyana Masyuk access to security group membership in Case360. I am not sure why i need to approve the access again, Tatyana always had it from the very beginning.

This is haste as reviewing letters is Tatyana's main function. I appreciate the assistance.

Good Morning:

I shut down and rebooted and RDS had Inspro and Case 360 back up already but the same error occurred. I'll keep trying different things and report back if anything changes.

Good morning,
Some of us are getting the same error message after we open up a claim in Case360. After hitting No to the error message below, I'm able to open a claim but then it would knocks me out of rds after I close the claim.  Also, we have to wait for about a few minutes to log back in to RDS - every single time.  Same thing happened when I try it again.

Thanks in advance.

I don't seem to be able to access the FTP staging server.

I'm told the IP address is: 10.40.0.45   but I can't reach that server (or at least not the 'root').

Can you help with this.

This is separate from the CCS/Pandora to FTP connection issue.

Can you please have this escalated and make sure the Synoptek teams knows that Steven is a CNA employee and if they can check his profile settings to see if that corrects the issue.

Steven has been out of production now since prior to 11am.

Hello,

I am the training manager and need Adobe Reader on my laptop.  I had it on my Capgemini laptop.  I use it to convert training materials to pdfs.

I tried to go to https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__get.adobe.com&d=DwIFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=lXVQKPQcW1NQNprS6zLd_35EsYwMHpO5zna_MGAJEtc&m=i5Qx5jYmQGbGfYseiweZ5q-T7Bpsl1XPJ49jt31syYA&s=_LeDuP1n2Uhqs0WMtHX478sgmH1oWieysqNYwOFymhA&e= and download the free version and my computer is pausing the download for an administrator username/password.

Please install or help me install this program on my laptop as it is essential to my job.

Thank you!

I am able to log onto the rds.chcs-services while connected to network via Ethernet in the CHCS office building.
However, when I am at my home and trying to connect and use apps inside the rds.chcs-services. It is very, very sluggish, it says that I am logged in but, when I try opening apps it seems to end my rds session and unable to open apps.

Email Body: 
I am requesting a REINSTALL of the Forticlient VPN software on my Cap Gemini desktop.

The software is CURRENTLY INSTALLED however it does not seem to be the correct version, it is not connected to Telemetry and it fails the VPN connection at 98%.

In order to reinstall I need to have forticlient uninstalled from my desktop which means I need admin credentials. I have attempted to reinstall the software with Synoptek IT but we do not have admin creds for this system.

Hi Support team,

I recently got a new CHCS laptop, earlier I had the CG laptop.

I thought FortiClient VPN would be pre-installed in this machine, but it is not installed.

I downloaded the FortiClient installer from the SharePoint location, but I am unable to install since I do not have admin privileges.

Please help me get FortiClient VPN installed.

Further, I believe I would need to be enrolled into Duo Mobile once again, please help in this regards as well.

Hello -

Can you please give me a sample of the login ID?

My understanding is that this was a Capgemini practice, and we are no longer using them.  If we are, where are we now generating them? Where are they going to be logged? Who will receive the information upon hire?  Where can we retrieve it when we are terminating access?

Hi Team,

As per our understanding Synoptek is going to pick CHCS System for Indian resources after their Exit.

We have already raised the request for below mention employees for system pickup, however none of them have received any call for system pickup.

Request you to please confirm by when the system will be picked up so that we can proceed further.

Again, I can't view TIF files in Case360.  This is at least the fourth time I've had this issue.  Each time I submit a ticket, and this issue is fixed, the problem comes back a few hours later, or the next day.  Currently, I get a user account control window asking me for an admin username and password whenever I try to open a TIF file.  Previously, Case360 has also just displayed an error message with a broken glass icon.  Is there something that can be done to fix this issue permanently?

Hi,

I recently got a new CHCS laptop and I am logging in to this machine using by existing email id(tanisha.bose@chcs-services.com<mailto:tanisha.bose@chcs-services.com>) but I noticed that I do not have company portal and FortiClient installed in this machine.

A few days back i received a notification of new CHCS email id(t.bose@chcs-services.com<mailto:t.bose@chcs-services.com>) i believe my new laptop is linked to this new email id. I do not want to use this email id as all my access and data setup is on my existing email id(tanisha.bose@chcs-services.com<mailto:tanisha.bose@chcs-services.com>).

I believe this issue is similar to the issue faced by my colleague Divyesh Kotekar for which he had logged the ticket#T20220319.0122. You can refer this ticket and follow the same resolution steps followed here.

Hi All,

Yesterday I was able to login to Keeper Vault, both by Duo Push and by entering OTP code from my phone.

Today, when I do either of above, I receive an additional screen below.
When I select Keeper Push - It states ""Keeper Push sent"" with a spinner - and nothing is sent to my phone.
Selected Admin Approval also - not sure if anything happened or where it goes to.

What do I need to do to resolve this? Any Assistance appreciated!

Hi,

I am unable to connect to AWS RDS, it is giving the following error.

I was able to connect to FortiClient VPN using my chcs-hosting id: dkotekar.

I am also able to connect to some remote machines using this id, but not able to access RDS.

[cid:image001.png@01D83E1F.C52C9050]

I am also unable to add this site (or any site) to the trusted list.

Hi Hunter,

Neither the password ""inspro"" nor the password you gave me on March 18th ""wuB+yTb6pK_x6F=3"" work for me at this point in the process.

Can you please help with the sizing/settings of my Inspro screens (PRU, PRD, Aflac)?

For whatever reason it is not saving the settings when I expand the Policy Abstract screen.  Then when I go to Claims Abstract screen, it is only half a screen, and it does not give me the option to expand.  I have attached screen shots below.

This is the size of the screen when I enter a policy number.  This is also the size the claims abstract screen gets stuck at.

I can expand the policy abstract screen, but not the claims abstract.

All,

We noticed that PRU OCC application is exporting indexed documents from OCC to Case360 however it is not clearing that transaction record in OCC.
We tried restarting the application services, but one of the services is not starting. There is no direct impact of this on production.

Please restart the VM ""IBSMANPRDAPP45"" during non-business preferably anytime between 8.30PM Central and 11PM Central.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I was had my profile reset because they thought I had an issue viewing Case 360 documents, which I did not.

Vipul,

pls confirm that the issue is resolved.

Vipul,

two servers,
IBSMANQAAPP04
IBSMANUATAPP05 was running ms windows defender app.
we have removed the defender and rebooted the servers.
Our team believe that the defender was the culprit.

Pls confirm one more time.

Good Afternoon,

I am having an issue with FlexiFinancials in AWS. Whenever I try to run a report Flexi attempts to run the report, but returns the error message below. Per our IT Department, my ""RDS Profile needs to be reset to get the application setup button on Flexi"" so that they can remedy this Flexi issue. Can you assist with resetting my profile?

Guys,

I just need a way to monitor Owen's load, not having tickets is difficult when we (Support Ops) only runs with tickets it is how we function. And this issue with MS has been going on for weeks, so I think we need a ticket so I know what
 kind of load we are putting on Owen, plus the ticket can track all the different thread replies so if we had to get someone else on this all of the info is in the ticket.

Thank You,
-Phil

CDS-Northwest,T20220325.0703,Flexi issues on RDS,"FROM: Thomas.Nguyen@chcs-services.com
FROM NAME: Thomas Nguyen
TO: customersupport@synoptek.com
CC: 

Email Body: 
Hi Team,
The Flexi users are reporting that when they log into RDS, they are having to set up the DB Connection.  Usually, once it is setup and they log in, it does not have to be done again.  Next day they log into RDS, the db setup is erased and setup is required again.    I know users are connecting to different RAS server on RDS, is there profile roaming to other servers?

Thanks,

Hi Suresh,

I can upgrade the AWS Instance Type for this server to an r4.large which would give you the following specifications.

Upgrade Option r4.large -- CPU-2 \ ARC-x86_64 \ 15.3GB-RAM \ NET-10Gb \ Windows .225 Hour

Current c5.large -- CPU-2 \ ARC-x86_64 \ 4GB-RAM \ NET-10Gb \ Windows $ - .177 per hour

If you would like to proceed please let me know an acceptable time to power the system down. Please also note that patches are pending and I would want to allow a complete cycle of the server before powering down, so I will need to add
 a few minutes to the outage for that.

Regards,

Good Afternoon,

I am having an issue with FlexiFinancials. When I am in the ""Payment Production"" screen the buttons at the bottom of the screen are in an odd position and I am unable to click the button that I need (see screenshot below). This is preventing me from issuing a check. Can you assist?

Hello All,

I have investigated this from the Trend Micro side. I have not seen any blocks for that server in trend in the past 60 day. I have also checked with our security team and they found nothing in Minerva. Can we get the exact file path/name
 of the exe file in question? I can add the exclusions to both just to make sure. Thank you!

Hi Adam,

Please see below email, where you have already confirmed that you have excluded all mentioned exe's. I just wanted to check you again to make sure that you have done the changes as today we got same error.

Hello Aman,

This is completed and should be fully deployed now. Please let me know if you have any questions thank you!

Exe's location:

Hi Aman,

I was meaning what is the exact name/file path of the file that may have been blocked by AV? If the FTP server loads the file into any temp folder while its downloading then the exclusion may fail. in my screen shot below that specific
 server does not show any flagged files or detections but maybe the destination system had one? Please let me know thank you!

Adding @Daniel Evans [mailto:devans@synoptek.com] from our Security Team he handles the Minerva Side and I asked him and no blocks were found at this time.

I have confirmed the exclusions are in place.

Please grant me all the accesses on FTP servers which FTP team members have. You can mirror all access like fazalsh -Faiz.Afzal-Shaikh@chcs-services.com<mailto:-Faiz.Afzal-Shaikh@chcs-services.com> accesses.

I cannot access Filer servers, App servers hence replicate all the access which FTP team has.

I created a bookmark and a shortcut for three different bank websites that I use often.  They were created yesterday afternoon around 5:00 P.M. CST.  This morning, both the bookmarks and the shortcuts were gone.  Is there a way to get them to stay ?  Below is a screenshot of Chrome showing the bookmarks and shortcuts yesterday afternoon and another screenshot from this morning showing the items no longer visible.

I have tried to adjust the display/zoom etc... in my system as have my co workers, but nothing we do fixes it. Im sure it has to do with the size of our laptop screens and other monitors, but several of us are having this issue.  Please please help. Thanks so much.

Hi Adam\Daniel,

We have tried to run the FTP job again, but still we are not able to transfer the files.

We are not sure if Trend Micro that is blocking this, can you not permanently stop scanning of below locations from trends to avoid this issue?

As I confirmed that whatever changes you had done on 15th March 2022 was working for us till yesterday.

Exe's location:
C:\Program Files\Ipswitch\MOVEit Automation Web Admin
C:\Program Files\MOVEit
D:\TEMP_NEW

Note:- Please always keep ftpservices@chcs-services.com<mailto:ftpservices@chcs-services.com> in loop.
Thank you.

Hello Aman,

I believe we have some confusion here We have those folders being excluded from Trend Micro Scans. This is permanent there have been no changes in your AV policy's. With Trend Micro it would alert and create a log if something was blocked
 by the AV product. I have looked through all the logs and find nothing being blocked. If you approve we could temporarily move this server into its own group in Trend Micro and Disable the Real Time Scanning and have you test. If the same issues happen then
 we would know Trend is not what is causing it. Please let me know. thank you!

Hello Asit,
We are currently revisiting and reviewing the NON-PROD CITRON suite of applications configurations again. Most of these were pushed to the back seat due to the priority placed on the PROD environment. There is a lot that needto be done on the Citron suite
 of applications to get them to a working state. Our estimated time for this will be towards end of next weekend. Thank you for your patience.

Ken / Vaibhav,

We need your urgent approval to resolve a connectivity issue between RDB DBs server in C1 to Flexi DB in C3 and avoid business impact.

Background of the issue: During AWS migration, Flexi team faced the issue of connecting to Flexi database in C1 from Flexi application. Due to this issue, they move the Flexi DB in C3 server. And last week he requested to disable Flexi DB in C1. This led to Aflac Daily Process to failed. So, we had to bring up the Flexi DB in C1 but it is a stale copy (not production version).

Work around: To overcome the above issue we implemented temporary workaround to restore Flex DB copy from C3 to C1. But DBA team ran into issues to copy file across VLANs and only way they could do it was using CIS server. Post 31-Mar-2022, we will not be able use this work around, and, in any case, this was a temporary solution.

Proposed Permanent Fix: We need connectivity open with RDB DBs in C1 and Flexi DB in C3 so that Aflac and BAU can consume latest data ","iBAS, Inc (CHCS)",CDS-Northwest,"DUBEY, SAHIL (primary) | PATEL, PARTH | REED, MIKE",Complete,P5 - Service Request,3/31/2022 13:00,4/7/2022 23:24,Single User,Server Management,Other,
